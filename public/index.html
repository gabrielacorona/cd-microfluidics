                <h1>Who we are</h1>
                Microfluidics refers to the behaviour, precise control, and manipulation of fluids that are
                geometrically constrained to a small scale (typically sub-millimeter) at which capillary penetration
                governs mass transport. It is a multidisciplinary field that involves engineering, physics, chemistry,
                biochemistry, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. It has practical applications in the design of systems
                that process low volumes of fluids to achieve multiplexing, automation, and high-throughput screening.
                Microfluidics emerged in the beginning of the 1980s and is used in the development of inkjet printheads,
                DNA chips, lab-on-a-chip technology, micro-propulsion, and micro-thermal technologies.

                <h2>Rats can Talk!</h2>
                Given that a great deal of technology for functional genomics is available in the mouse, how important
                is the rat as a model organism? For the last 30 years, investigators have chosen to use mouse models
                because of the technologies that are available. Now that the same technologies are at hand with the rat,
                scientists will be able to choose the most appropriate model based on the biology, whether it is rat,
                mouse or both. Even though these species look similar, there are millions of years of evolution
                separating the rat and mouse, and there are significant differences between them.

                As a model of human disease, the rat offers many advantages over the mouse and other organisms. In fact,
                rats were once the most widely used organism in medical research, and the successful isolation of rat ES
                (embryo-derived stem) cells will quickly expand their utility. The rat is an excellent model for
                cardiovascular disease, particularly for stroke and hypertension, and there are a variety of genetic
                stocks that are ideal for these studies. The physiology is easier to monitor in the rat and, over time,
                a volume of data has developed that will take years to be replicated in the mouse.

                <h3>Cashier</h3>
                Squidward Q.Tentacles is a fictional character voiced by actor Rodger Bumpass in the American
                animated television series SpongeBob SquarePants. Squidward was created and designed by marine
                biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He first appeared on television in the series' pilot
                episode "Help Wanted" on May 1, 1999.

                Although his name has the word "squid" in it, Squidward is an anthropomorphic octopus.[a] He lives
                in a moai between SpongeBob SquarePants' and Patrick Star's houses. The character is portrayed as
                ill-tempered and pretentious, and he dislikes his two neighbors' constant noisy behavior. However,
                the pair are unaware of Squidward's antipathy towards them and see him as a friend. Squidward works
                as a cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant, a job that he is apathetic towards.
